# Description
The purpose of this application is to provide code developers with a quick and easy way to share and discuss their code with
their colleagues and like-minded individuals. We created the interface to be simple and easy to use, to make it appealing to
those who just want to sign in and get to chatting. To aid with this, we implemented the Google Sign-In API, to make signing in 
as easy as possible!
